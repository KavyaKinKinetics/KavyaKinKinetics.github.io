                    KinKinetics had the exceptional opportunity to participate in the <strong>20th NeuroPsychoEconomics Conference</strong> held in Milan in June 2024. This prestigious event was a convergence of leading minds exploring the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and economics, providing profound insights into cognitive support mechanisms.

                    One of the highlights was an enlightening talk by <strong>Thomas Zoëga Ramsøy</strong>, CEO and founder of Neurons Inc. He offered invaluable insights into the practical applications of consumer neuroscience, delving deep into consumer behavior and the underlying neural processes. His expertise shed light on how understanding the brain's workings can enhance marketing strategies and consumer engagement.

                    Another remarkable presentation was delivered by <strong>Professor Benjamin Scheibehenne</strong> from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. As a full professor of cognition and cognitive decision-making, he explored how individual behaviors influence economic decisions. His talk was truly mind-blowing, providing a comprehensive analysis of the cognitive factors that drive economic outcomes.

                     Neural foundation of cognition and decision-making was explained in the session by exploring the roles of cortical and subcortical structures. It highlights how ontogeny, reflecting individuality and adaptability, is closely associated with cortical structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, which is crucial for executive functions, planning, and decision-making. On the other hand, phylogeny, representing shared evolutionary traits, relates to deeper subcortical structures, like the amygdala and basal ganglia, which are vital for processing emotions, reward, and reinforcement learning. Together, these regions illustrate the brain's intricate balance between evolutionarily preserved mechanisms and individual adaptability, which drive complex cognitive and decision-making processes.Our team was proud to represent KinKinetics at this influential event. The collective experiences and knowledge gained are pivotal in advancing our mission to enhance cognitive support technologies.

                    At KinKinetics, we utilize advancements in neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and behavioral science to deepen our understanding of the human brain. By combining these insights with cutting-edge technologies, we recreate the essence of "kin" to provide profound psychological and emotional support. Our approach integrates the neural mechanisms behind behavior with tailored training systems that enhance the behavioral and emotional dimensions of human interactions. This interdisciplinary fusion of neuroscience and technology enables us to deliver meaningful and impactful support, fostering stronger connections and emotional well-being.The core of this technology revolves around a sophisticated AI system designed to monitor and analyze decisions in real-time.
