                    KinKinetics had the honor of presenting at the prestigious <strong>ELGRA Conference 2024</strong>. This international event brought together experts in gravitational and space biology, engineering, and neuroscience to discuss advancements in long-duration space missions. Our presentation focused on the intersection of neuroeconomics and its application in optimizing human performance in extreme environments.We were absolutely honored to be awarded a prestigious scholarship during the ELGRA Conference 2024, which acknowledged our efforts in advancing neuroeconomics for long-duration space missions. As a part of this recognition, we had the privilege of receiving a signed photo of astronaut Tim Peake. This incredible gesture serves as a testament to our commitment to innovation and collaboration in addressing the unique challenges of space exploration.

                    Neuroeconomics, an interdisciplinary field, combines neuroscience, behavioral economics, and psychology to understand decision-making processes. At KinKinetics, we highlighted how this framework is pivotal in addressing the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral challenges faced during extended space missions.

                    One of the key takeaways from the conference was the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in tackling challenges unique to space environments. Engaging with leading researchers and industry professionals allowed KinKinetics to exchange ideas on how neuroeconomics can help astronauts adapt to cognitive fatigue, decision-making under stress, and emotional resilience during isolation.
