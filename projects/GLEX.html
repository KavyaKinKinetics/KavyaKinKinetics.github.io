                    Participating in <strong>GLEX 2025</strong> was a tremendous honour for the KinKinetics team. After months of dedicated preparation, we had the privilege of presenting our <em>Neuroadaptive Efficiency Paradigm</em>—our novel framework that integrates neuroeconomics and real-time physiological monitoring to optimise both mission objectives and astronaut well-being. Sharing our research on such a prestigious global stage reaffirmed the importance of psychological and emotional support in the next era of space exploration.

                <p>
                    We were thrilled to engage with leading researchers from <strong>ISRO</strong> and other space agencies, exchanging ideas on how the Neuroadaptive Efficiency Paradigm can address cognitive fatigue, decision-making under stress, and emotional resilience during long-duration missions. These interdisciplinary conversations sparked potential collaborations that will help translate our model into operational applications.

                <p>
                    A highlight of GLEX was the panel discussion alongside celebrated astronauts and international dignitaries. Hearing firsthand accounts from crew members underscored the critical need for robust mental-health support systems in orbit. The insights we gained will directly inform the next iteration of our paradigm and help strengthen mission safety and performance.

                <p>
                    Beyond the sessions, the networking at Yashobhoomi was unparalleled. From meeting world-leading space entrepreneurs to forging partnerships with startups and established agencies, every conversation fuelled our passion for space entrepreneurship. We’re deeply grateful to Women in Aerospace (WIA) for funding our participation, which made this milestone achievement possible.
