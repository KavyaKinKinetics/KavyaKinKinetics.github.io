                   Emotional intelligence (EI) plays a crucial role in enhancing decision-making processes, particularly in leadership contexts. Research has shown that EI can significantly influence the effectiveness and quality of decisions made by individuals and groups.

Hess and Bacigalupo (2011) propose a practical approach to applying emotional intelligence skills in decision-making. They argue that by developing and utilizing behaviors associated with EI, organizations and individuals can improve both the quality and effectiveness of their decision-making processes. Their research outlines a methodology based on Goleman's and Boyatzis et al.'s four essential elements of emotional intelligence and the associated 20 behavioral competencies. This framework provides decision-makers with a series of questions and observations to enhance their EI awareness and apply these skills to decision-making.

In the context of leadership, enhancing emotional intelligence transcends traditional decision-making models by adding dimensions of empathy and understanding. Leaders who cultivate their emotional intelligence can navigate complex situations more effectively, fostering a leadership style that is responsive, informed, and human-centric.

The relationship between EI and decision-making is not static but evolves with experience and age. Studies have shown that increasing age and years of experience are associated with higher levels of emotional intelligence, which in turn positively influences decision-making abilities. This suggests that EI can be developed over time, offering a pathway for continuous improvement in decision-making skills throughout a leader's career.
